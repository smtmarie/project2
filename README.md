# DENBIZ

## Overview
This full-stack web application was a group collaboration of design and functioning using the MVC paradigm and our own server-side API. 

## User Story
As a Denver area small business owner, I will utilize this application to list my business and services to gain exposure and connect with potential customers. 
As a Denverite, I will search for small businesses of my interest, so I can support the local community.
